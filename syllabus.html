<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>This class will expose you to a spectrum of puzzle styles and mechanics, and it will give you the tools for crafting your own. Your output will mostly be puzzles that naturally blend into the environment and provide gating mechanisms for the theatrical trails within the ParaSite ARG. The class will focus heavily on the practice of puzzle-solving and on iterative puzzle development.</p>
