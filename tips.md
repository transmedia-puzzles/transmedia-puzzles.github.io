title: Things I wish I knew as a first-year

I wish someone really showed me how easy using CTA was and told me about all of the free things made available (classes at Logan and CSIL, TechBar borrowing, etc.).

Meeting all these interesting people who’d been super successful in high school in order to get a place here at all did make me feel inadequate. There’s a pretty big culture of competition here. And not hearing until halfway through my second year that I was not alone in doing things like withdrawing from classes or seeing a psychiatrist, because I had this perception that everyone else was super successful, so the fact that I wasn’t put me at the bottom of the heap. Though I also don’t want the super bad culture of “oh you only got four hours of sleep? Lucky, I got three” to be normalized. I guess a sort of peer mentorship thing would be helpful. Often when people post on UChicago Secrets about their academic issues I’ll comment with things that were helpful for me to know about academic policies, number one to get that information out there because academic advisors here are actually pretty bad at communicating information, and two to show people that having such difficulties is nothing to be ashamed of, that this is a thing that many people go through, and to present myself as a friendly resource for people.

Restaurants in the Reynold’s Club. I only found out about this late in the year. Because the dining halls are closed Saturday nights, the restaurants in the Reynold’s Club I would hit up to go grab grub at night.

Felt rushed into buying all my books - instead of being told about online versions etc. 

I wish I had been made to interact with others more during the week. I spent almost the whole time hiding in my room, but when I did go out (especially when I was with my house) I had a ton of fun. So I guess I wish I had been forced (not a good word, but all I can think of) to participate more, because left to my own devices I tended to isolate myself. 

I wish that someone had explained the class selection system more clearly, although I understand that the system is changing significantly from what it was this year.

Signs you might need help with your own mental health, especially regarding classes

I wish I knew more about social outlets on campus! I learned plenty about my House and the people in it, but I didn't know much about social RSO’s, Greek Life, or just student groups in general.

The ArtsPass and what it entails, as well as the free printing offered by CCSS (College Center for Student Success) (these are niche things but I wish I had known about them during O-Week!)

Don’t be afraid to reach out to professors who teach lecture classes because you think they don’t notice you. (Alternatively, don’t take lecture classes. If the size intimidates you or makes you fall asleep, you should go for seminar or practicum courses.) On another note, don’t be afraid to take grad classes because you’re afraid of getting a bad grade. Take the classes that interest you and write papers about topics you’re passionate about.

One aspect I wish had been more stressed is that it’s okay to ask for help. God knows how many sleepless nights stressing out over paper deadlines I might have saved myself from had I just gone to the writing tutors for aid.

It’s OK to sign up for a bunch of RSOs at the very beginning and then go to none of them—everyone’s interests change and you don’t HAVE to do model UN anymore
Having a bike is really helpful and opens up a lot of Hyde Park before you move off campus and realize walking to CVS is actually pretty quick
If you do get a bike then be sure to get a U Lock! Every bike outside my dorm that was locked with a cable was stolen in one night my first year.
It’s weird to think of the library as a social hub, but it is. Go there, do your homework in groups, and make friends.

I wish someone explained to me which stigmas on campus are B.S. and which are actually important,  I also wish someone explained to me how useful a resource RAs were; I definitely came into college with my own stereotypes (mostly which came from CollegeHumor), but it was only really this quarter that I realized how commonly people in my house went to them for help.  Oh, knowing all the majors would be nice to (didn’t realize, for instance, that the BioChem major is more a Chem major than a Bio major)

I wish I had known how useful it is to explore different groups.  I spent most of my first year trying out for a sports team I would eventually quit in the spring, and at that time, I really didn’t know what group I belonged in.  Housing is nice and you can meet people that way, but getting involved in multiple rso’s, teams, and clubs is a better option in my opinion towards finding really enjoyable experiences and lasting friendships.  I didn’t realize until the beginning of my second year that by pigeonholing myself into one group, I had spent a year without really learning anything about who my friends are or who I want to be in college.
