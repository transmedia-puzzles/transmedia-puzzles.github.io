## Description

This class will expose you to a spectrum of puzzle styles and mechanics, and it will give you the tools for crafting your own. Your output will mostly be puzzles that can be presented on paper, in audio or video format, or via web browser. The class will focus heavily on the practice of puzzle-solving and on iterative puzzle development.

## Expectations, puzzle-wise

* Solve all the puzzles you're assigned. If that means asking for hints until you get it, do that.
* Shift your day-to-day perception so that you're constantly on the lookout for how the words and things around you can be turned into a puzzle.
* Be willing to playtest and offer helpful critique to your classmates.
* If you're not getting it, ask.
* Plagiarism is not tolerated. But, as with all art, there is a blurry line between inspiration and thievery. A puzzle _mechanic_ may be stolen; the entire puzzle must not be. If you are unsure whether something constitutes plagiarism, _contact me in advance_. Academic dishonesty is a very serious offense — even if it is unintentional. The penalty for plagiarism might include both failure on the paper and failure of this course. Please review the University of Chicago’s official policy online.

## Expectations, other-wise

* Arrive on time!
* **Attendance** is required for this course. Students absent for more than one class risk lowering their participation grade; students with more than three unexcused absences will be given a final grade of incomplete or fail.
* **Preparation**. Do the reading and take the puzzle solving seriously. 
* **Phones and Laptops**. Cell phones must absolutely be turned off in class. While laptops are permitted, we recommend that anyone tempted to check in with social media, email, and other sites unrelated to class should stick to pen and paper for note-taking. If you have a compulsion about emailing, messaging, or checking social media during class (and cannot control yourself), you should absolutely refrain from keeping your laptop open in class.
* **Late Papers and Extensions**. If any assignment is late, surpassing the deadline, it will immediately drop half grade (e.g. from a B to B-). The grade will continue to drop at a comparable increment every 24 hours thereafter. We do grant extensions (especially in cases of major life events or emergencies) but you should talk to me about this possibility well in advance of the deadline.
* **Student Disability Services**. We are committed to meeting the needs of all students. To arrange class-related accommodations, please see [Student Disability Services](http://disabilities.uchicago.edu/accommodations) prior to scheduling a meeting with us.
