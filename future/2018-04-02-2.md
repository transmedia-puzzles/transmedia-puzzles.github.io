## Journal Prompts

Please put these at the top of your journal doc. Please don't create a new document.

* How was the pacing of today vs. first week?
* Something you know about puzzles that I didn’t know two weeks ago.
* What’s one question you have from class today?

## Homework

### Consume

* Watch [How to Solve a Mystery Hunt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9OHLnIEegI). You can scrub through uninteresting parts and the parts about solving walkarounds on campus.

### Play one of the following:

* The Room 1, 2 or 3 (mobile game, best on tablet)
* Blackbox
* Progress to 100

If you don't have a device that can play any of these, find another puzzle game but pass it by me first.

### Do in week 1 groups

* Refine your week 1 puzzles based on feedback. **Submit revised puzzles.**

### Solve in week 2 groups

* Solve Pintopia Brewery Tours. **Submit solutions.**

### Make in week 2 groups

* **Mapping puzzle.** Continue building the puzzle you started in class.

* **Physical puzzle.** Write an ordering puzzle using [one of your lists (or someone else's)](/lists) and a set of _physical_ objects. You're making a physical puzzle. If the object you choose is exotic or difficult to acquire at this moment (but eventually it'd be possible), go ahead and fake it for now. Bring prototypes instead of the real thing. But you must really make the puzzle. The idea here is to make a puzzle that could theoretically be distributed among many people and only solveable once the items were brought together. **Write up puzzle and bring to class.**
