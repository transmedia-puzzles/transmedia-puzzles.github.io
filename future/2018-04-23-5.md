**3/5 of a Puzzled Pint set.** Final set will have 4 puzzles and a meta.

First pick a theme. Use one of the themes you picked. Or pick a new one.

Brainstorm a bunch of puzzles. Try to pick a variety of styles. Include one logic puzzle. Build off your theme as much as possible.

Start by determining the structure of the meta, and how the four solutions will fit together for it.

Then build the meta and 2 of the 4 puzzles.

Print your puzzles for class next week.
