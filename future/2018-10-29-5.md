## Journal Prompts

Please put these at the *top of your journal doc*. Please don't create a new document.

- How did class go today?
- What’s a website you visit or app you use that I’ve probably never been to?

## Read

[After the Death Card, with Eleanor Hyde](http://biggameswithace.blogspot.com/2014/11/interview-after-death-card-with-eleanor.html). Eleanor is visiting next week. Prepare some questions for her.

## Homework

### Do, individually

* Post in your journals. (See above.)

### Solve, if you didn't last time (optional!)

* [Adventures in Puzzling Episode #3](/pdf/AiP-ep3.pdf). This is optional and not graded this week.

### Make, in groups


**Build a video puzzle.** This puzzle should take the form of a video. The videos used during the ARG will be instructional, or at least educational, about one of [the four topics](/2018a/modules). The real video will be several minutes long, though yours can be about a minute. Think about how to use the medium of video to convey a message. The solution should be this Twitter handle: [**@whetherpatterns**](https://twitter.com/whetherpatterns).


**Twitter puzzles**. Have a look at my Twitter feed. (The relevant ones are collected in [this collection](https://twitter.com/i/moments/1026114861980430337).) Every tweet is one of three formats:

* find what's in common ([example](https://twitter.com/pzlr/status/1057270960041181189))
* find the pattern and add something creative ([example](https://twitter.com/pzlr/status/1042046735542112261))
* find what can come next ([example](https://twitter.com/pzlr/status/1055811196664901632))

Please pick one of these formats and write one.
