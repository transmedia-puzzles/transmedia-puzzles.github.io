## Puzzle ideas

1. Books
2. Swag box: podcards, mask + note, 16 pieces divided among 16 boxes
3. Map, mailed out. Diff between virtual tour and street view.
4. Podcast. Different languages, released over time, out of order. Maniuplate URl to find missing eps.
5. FB event. McD's meetup, lots of cities
6. Pre-reg. Use canvas.
7. Slack
8. Twitter. Who it follows. Follow them -> get a DM
9. Fake Maroon mailed to all students
10. Online escape game
11. Scan & Deliver
12. Instagram, selective follow permission based on geography
13. Wiki metadata
14. Fake course + evalutation
15. Retweets of other acounts, but all those tweets together resolve to something.

## Modules


### Module 1: History and Archaeology Fourcast

In this series of puzzles and challenges, players uncover historical approaches to environmental studies within the United States and in transnational contexts. Contemporary perspectives on climate too often elicit a variety of presentist responses that undervalue the past as a site for better understanding and acting within the future. This Fourcast explores varied histories of climate and their relationship to the geophysical sciences, connecting the past, present and future through human experience. The production team will work most closely on this module with a group of advisors that includes Dipesh Chakrabarty (History), Edgar Garcia (English), Lynne Heasley (Environmental Humanities), Fredrik Albritton Jonsson (History), Catherine Kearns (Classics), and Ada Palmer (History).

### Module 2: Narrative and Art Fourcast

This module recasts environmental and geophysical sciences through narrative as it unfolds in literature and the media arts practice. Literary and art practices, and corresponding humanistic analytical techniques, continue to expand genres such as climate fiction, utopian fiction, and forecasting games that explore possible and plausible future scenarios. This Fourcast module opens up possibilities not envisioned within empirical disciplines by speculating about adaptation, endurance, and innovation. The production team will work most closely on this module with a group of advisors that includes Wai Chee Dimock (English), Marc Downie (Cinema & Media Studies), Ken Eklund (Game Studies), Edgar Garcia (English), Lynne Heasley (Environmental Humanities), Benjamin Morgan (English), and Ada Palmer (History).

### Module 3: Energy and Science Fourcast

This module explores the human impact on climate through the geophysical sciences. Environmental sciences was developed through advances in physics, chemistry, economics, and atmospheric sciences. While this Fourcast may appear to be furthest from humanistic knowledge, it familiarizes players with key scientific findings and invites STEM students to enter into conversation with humanists. The production team will work most closely on this module with a group of advisors that includes David Archer (Geophysical Sciences), Michael Greenstone (Economics), and Craig Segall (Law). For game content, this module draws from and repurposes Professor Archerâ€™s open-access online courses (MOOCs), titled /Global Warming I & II/.

### Module 4: Society and Policy Fourcast

This module analyzes the relationship between human beings and environments as it unfolds in the humanistic social sciences, especially sociological and anthropological frameworks. Human culture and science have transformed dramatically, especially during the past 30 years. This Fourcast forges intersections between issues of environmental sustainability, racial justice, and gender studies. The production team will work most closely on this module with a group of advisors that includes Michael Greenstone (Economics), Kimberly Hoang (Sociology), Ryan Jobson (Anthropology), Craig Segall (Law), and Robert Vargas (Sociology).
