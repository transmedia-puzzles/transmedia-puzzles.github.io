## Homework (groups)

* Post your pysical playtest notes.
* Refine your week 2 physical puzzles based on feedback. **Submit revised puzzles digitally.**

* Playtest your mapping/bigram puzzle with a stranger (not in class)
* Post notes and revisions

### Solve, in week 3 groups

* [Pintopia Brewery Tours](/pdf/Pintopia_Brewery_Tours.pdf). **Submit final meta solution.**

<!-- ### Write, in week 3 groups -->

<!-- * 3 ideas for a Puzzled Pint theme, and 3 puzzle proposals for each theme. -->

### Make, in week 3 groups

* **Real-world puzzle.** Write an puzzle using one [the campus objects on this list](/campus).
* **Human-based puzzle.** How could an actor work in a puzzle? Be prepated to perform it in class.
* **URL puzzle**. Encode a URL in a letter somehow. Write up a fake letter from the dean to an incoming first-year, and embed a URL somehow. Fake the URL for now. If you'd like the puzzle to work _across_ multiple letters — i.e. players would need to team up to solve it — that'd be ok by me.
