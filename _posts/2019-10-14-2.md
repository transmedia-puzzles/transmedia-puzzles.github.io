## Homework (individual)

### Consume

* Watch [How to Solve a Mystery Hunt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9OHLnIEegI). You can scrub through uninteresting parts and the parts about solving walkarounds on campus.

## Homework (groups)

### Do in week 1 groups

* Refine your week 1 puzzles based on feedback. **Submit playtest notes and revised puzzles.**

### Solve in week 2 groups

* Solve [Pintopia Press](/pdf/Pintopia_Press.pdf). **Submit solutions.**

### Make in week 2 groups

* **Mapping or bigram puzzle**. Build a puzzle that either a) involves mapping (position in one words leads to index in another) or b) uses a set of abbreviations (letters and bigrams). **Submit puzzle and solutions. And bring 2 copies to class**

* **Physical puzzle.** Write an ordering puzzle and a set of _physical_ objects. You're making a physical puzzle. If the object you choose is exotic or difficult to acquire at this moment (but eventually it'd be possible), go ahead and fake the objects for now. The idea here is to make a puzzle that could theoretically be distributed among many people and only solvable once the items were brought together. **Build puzzle and bring it to class to be playtested.**
