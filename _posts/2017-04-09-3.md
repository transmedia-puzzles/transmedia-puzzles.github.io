### Do, individually

* Post in your journals. (See above.)

* For each theme idea, write up 3 puzzle proposals. Each can be a paragraph, wherein you describe the format the puzzle would take and what the mechanic would be, roughly.

### Do, in week 2 groups

* Post your playtest notes.
* Refine your week 2 puzzles based on feedback. **Submit revised puzzles digitally.**

### Make, in week 3 groups

* **Real-world puzzle.** Write an puzzle using one [the campus objects on this list](/campus). How would you have students interact with that object to make it a puzzle? The puzzle should be a combination of some permanent item on campus along with some other material — which could be some info delivered via email, or a physical item, or a performance. Up to you. **Write up puzzle and puzzle solution.**

* **Human-based puzzle.** How could an actor work in a puzzle? **Write up puzzle with sample interactions, and solution.**
