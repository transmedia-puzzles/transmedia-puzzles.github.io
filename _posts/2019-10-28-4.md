## Homework (groups)

### Do, in week 3 groups

1. Post your Human puzzle playtest notes.
2. Refine your Human puzzles based on feedback.
3. Add *variations* to the human puzzle. How would you enact it three more times, with slight variations so the same people don't immediately know the answer?

You won't need to re-perform it in class, but be prepared to explain your changes.

### Solve, in week 4 groups (optional!)

* [Adventures in Puzzling Episode #3](/pdf/AiP-ep3.pdf). This is optional and not graded this week.

### Make, in week 4 groups
