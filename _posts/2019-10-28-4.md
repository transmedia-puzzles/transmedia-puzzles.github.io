## Homework (individual)

### Watch

* Read [The Nature of Puzzles](/pdf/Nature-of-puzzles.pdf)
* Watch this video on [Forrest Fenn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4ahNpQLgdk&feature=youtu.be).
 [Scott Kim’s TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/scott_kim_takes_apart_the_art_of_puzzles)

### Play one of the following:

* The Room (mobile game, best on tablet, play any of the 4 versions)
* Blackbox
* Progress to 100

If you don't have a device that can play any of these, find another puzzle game but pass it by me first.

### Do

* Post in your journals. (See above.)

### Solve

* Logic puzzles (see canvas)

## Homework (groups)

### Do, in week 3 groups

1. Post your Human puzzle playtest notes.
2. Refine your Human puzzles based on feedback.
3. Add *variations* to the human puzzle. How would you enact it three more times, with slight variations so the same people don't immediately know the answer?

You won't need to re-perform it in class, but be prepared to explain your changes.

### Solve, in week 4 groups (optional!)

* [Adventures in Puzzling Episode #3](/pdf/AiP-ep3.pdf). This is optional and not graded this week.

### Make, in week 4 groups

**Puzzled Pint set**

* Pick a theme, pass it by me.
* 1 meta puzzle
* 2 feeder puzzles

See Canvas for explanations.
