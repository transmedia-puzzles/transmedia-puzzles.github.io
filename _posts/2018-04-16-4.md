## Homework

### Watch, individually

* [Scott Kim’s TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/scott_kim_takes_apart_the_art_of_puzzles)

### Read, individually

[After the Death Card, with Eleanor Hyde](http://biggameswithace.blogspot.com/2014/11/interview-after-death-card-with-eleanor.html). Eleanor is visiting next week. Prepare some questions for her.

### Do, individually

* Post in your journals. (See above.)

### Do, in week 3 groups

1. Post your Human puzzle playtest notes.
2. Refine your Human puzzles based on feedback.
3. Add *variations* to the human puzzle. How would you enact it three more times, with slight variations so the same people don't immediately know the answer?

### Playtest, in week 4 groups

* Solve and give feedback for [Puzzled Pint: Charlie & The Chocolate Factory](https://airtable.com/shrDVJqk4kJOym5cc). **Submit the form for each puzzle.**

### Make, in week 4 groups

**3/5 of a Puzzled Pint set.** Final set will have 4 puzzles and a meta.

First pick a theme. Use one of the themes you came up with last week. Or pick a new one.

Brainstorm a bunch of puzzles. Try to pick a variety of styles. Include one logic puzzle. Build off your theme as much as possible.

Start by determining the structure of the meta, and how the four solutions will fit together for it.

Then build the meta and 2 of the 4 puzzles.

Print your puzzles for class next week.
