## Journal Prompts

Please put these at the *top of your journal doc*. Please don't create a new document.

- How did class go today?
- What do you prefer we do for a final project?
- What is the most interesting class you've taken at U of C?

## Week 6 groups

* Group 1: Pamela Sorrells, Ashley Diaz
* Group 2: Alex Markowitz, Jacob Gold, Brendan Sanderson
* Group 3: Fred Dan, Albert Aboaf, Suhasni Singh
* Group 4: Alex Cantave, Tom Wilson
* Group 5: Isaac Harris, Carl Padgett, Jihana Mendu

## Homework, individually

* Post in your journals. (See above.)

## Do, in Week 4 groups

1. Post your playtest notes.
2. Refine puzzles based on notes. No need to update Twitter or Insta accounts, just describe what you'd change.

## Solve, in Week 6 groups (optional)

* [UFOs](/pdf/UFOs.pdf). Send me your playtest notes.

## Make, in Week 6 groups

* **Two more puzzles for a module for the ARG.** Your puzzle can start anywhere (other than Instagram or Twitter). For each puzzle, think about distributing the content: over a podcast, over Canvas, among the swag boxes, etc.
* **A brief** on how you'd build an Augmented Reality puzzle in Logan. Walk me through how the puzzle would work, though you don't need to build the puzzle yet. (We'll do it later.)
