## Journal Prompts

Please put these at the *top of your journal doc*.

- How did class go today?
- What's been a favorite puzzle that you've seen in class (other than one of your own)?
- What's your favorite thing to do in Chicago?

## Groups

1. Melissa, Michael, Samantha, Rebecca
2. Bill, Maddie, Molly
3. Olinka, Bri, Sebastian
4. Grace, Ethan, Rebecca

## Homework, individually

* Post in your journals. (See above.)
* Read intro to [Puzzlecraft](/pdf/puzzlecraft.pdf).
* Read cryptics chapter in Puzzlecraft.

## Homework, groups

### Do, in Week 6 groups

* Post your playtest notes.
* Post your notes about your revised walkaround puzzle.

### Solve any 3 of these

* [Elf Adventures](/pdf/elf_adventures.pdf) by me
* [Band-Aids](/pdf/band-aids.pdf) by me
* [Splicing](/pdf/splicing.pdf) by Mark Halpin
* [The Library](/pdf/the_library.pdf) by Foggy Brume
* [Far From Battle](/pdf/far_from_battle.pdf) by Foggy Brume

The last 3 are hard, so feel free to ping me for hints.

### Make in final groups

*A structure for your final project.* By "structure" I'm looking for: 

* The story of your game
* What medium it will take. Create some examples of objects that will be in your box.
* 3 high level puzzle ideas

See Canvas for an explanation of the constraints for the game you're building.
