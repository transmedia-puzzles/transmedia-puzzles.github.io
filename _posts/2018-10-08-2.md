## Homework (individual)

### Consume

* Watch [How to Solve a Mystery Hunt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9OHLnIEegI). You can scrub through uninteresting parts and the parts about solving walkarounds on campus.

### Play one of the following:

* The Room 1, 2 or 3 (mobile game, best on tablet)
* Blackbox
* Progress to 100

If you don't have a device that can play any of these, find another puzzle game but pass it by me first.

## Homework (groups)

### Do in week 1 groups

* Refine your week 1 puzzles based on feedback. **Submit playtest notes and revised puzzles.**

### Solve in week 2 groups

* Solve [Pintopia Press](/pdf/Pintopia_Press.pdf). **Submit solutions.**

### Make in week 2 groups

* **Mapping or bigram puzzle**. Build a puzzle that either a) involves mapping (position in one words leads to index in another) or b) uses a set of abbreviations (letters and bigrams). **Submit puzzle and solutions.**

* **Physical puzzle.** Write an ordering puzzle using [one of your lists (or someone else's)](/lists) and a set of _physical_ objects. You're making a physical puzzle. If the object you choose is exotic or difficult to acquire at this moment (but eventually it'd be possible), go ahead and fake the objects for now. The idea here is to make a puzzle that could theoretically be distributed among many people and only solvable once the items were brought together. **Build puzzle and bring it to class to be playtested.**
