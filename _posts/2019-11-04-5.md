**Twitter puzzles**. Have a look at [my Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/pzlr). Every tweet is one of three formats:

* find what's in common ([example](https://twitter.com/pzlr/status/1057270960041181189))
* find the pattern and add something creative ([example](https://twitter.com/pzlr/status/1042046735542112261))
* find what can come next ([example](https://twitter.com/pzlr/status/1055811196664901632))

Please pick one of these formats and write one.
