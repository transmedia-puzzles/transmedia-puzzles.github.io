## ARG Learning Objectives

1. Knowing available resources on campus (e.g., how to use the library, where the Center for Identity and Inclusion is located, what kind of programming the Gender and Race Centers offer).
2. Being able to get around campus, Hyde Park, and Chicago.
3. Being comfortable speaking with professors.

## Journal Prompts

Please put these at the top of your journal doc. Please don't create a new document.

* How was the pacing of today vs. first week?
* Something I know about puzzles that I didn’t know two weeks ago.
* What’s one question you have from class today?

## Homework

1. Create a Google Drive Folder.
2. Name it with the names of your team members.
3. Put _all_ your homework in there, each in a different doc/file.
4. Share it with sandor@mysteryleague.com.

 **Bold** indicates which things have a component that needs to be submitted.

### Consume

* Read this post on [puzzle dependency charts](http://grumpygamer.com/puzzle_dependency_charts)
* Watch [How to Solve a Mystery Hunt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9OHLnIEegI) especially walkaround part in middle. You can scrub through uninteresting parts.

### Play one of the following:

* The Room 1, 2 or 3 (mobile game, best on tablet)
* Blackbox
* Progress to 100

If you don't have a device that can play any of these, find another puzzle game but pass it by me first.

### Do in week 1 groups

* Refine your week 1 puzzles based on feedback.

### Solve in week 2 groups

* Solve Pintopia Brewery Tours. **Submit solutions.**

### Make in week 2 groups

* *Write an ordering puzzle using one of your lists and a set of physical objects.* The idea here is to make a physical puzzle. If the object you choose is exotic or difficult to acquire at this moment (but eventually it'd be possible), go ahead and fake it for now. Bring prototypes instead of the real thing. But you must really make the puzzle. The idea here is to make a puzzle that could theoretically be distributed among many people and only solveable once the items were brought together.

* *Write proposal for how we can use walkaround to introduce campus to players.* This should be a game that can be run with 50-100 people. How do you get 50-100 people to solve a puzzle together? What's the puzzle element, and is it different than the walkaround element? Consider the Learning Objectives posted above, as well as the objective of getting students to interface with students of different background, specialities, interests, etc. You don't need to actually build the puzzle out yet, but you do need to explain the mechanics of dealing with that many people. *Submit 2+ page proposal, including a route of where on campus you'd want people to go.*
